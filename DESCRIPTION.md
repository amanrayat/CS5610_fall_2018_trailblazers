Problem Statement - 
Among the many first world problems, finding breweries which serve our preferences and
connecting with fellow beer enthusiast have proven themselves as problems to be 
solved. Since beer has proven itself as a vital social construct, people who love
to drink beer and people who want to sell beer must be given a common platform. 


Target Audience - 
Drinkers - These type of users 
1. Would be able to find breweries in their preferable localities
2. Can share their experience at breweries
3. Can access guild event/brewery events

Breweries - These type of users

Solution Proposal -

according to their preferences. The intent here is to bring together two user entities
:- the people who want to buy beer and the people who want to sell beer.
